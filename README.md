## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests movies based on user ratings and preferences.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses user behavior data to recommend films that similar users enjoyed.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on the features of previously liked films.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple interface to input preferences and view recommendations.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MalyajNailwal/movie-recommender-system-project.git
   cd movie-recommender-system-project
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided in the repository.

3. Load the dataset and follow the instructions to preprocess the data and train the recommendation model.

4. Input your movie ratings/preferences to receive personalized movie recommendations.

## Data Sources

The dataset used for this project can be sourced from:

- [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) for user ratings and movie metadata.
- Other publicly available movie datasets.

Ensure that you comply with the data usage policies of these sources.

## Recommendation Techniques

This project employs the following recommendation techniques:

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Identifies patterns in user behavior and recommends movies based on similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Analyzes movie features (e.g., genre, director, actors) to recommend similar films based on user preferences.

## Results

The recommender system provides a list of movies tailored to the userâ€™s preferences. Performance can be evaluated based on:

- Precision and Recall of the recommendations.
- User satisfaction through feedback on suggested movies.

Example output includes a ranked list of recommended movies along with their ratings.
